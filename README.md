# Diabetes Predicion Machine Learning Project

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project to detect diabetes based on certain medical features.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on a set of input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), etc. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of patients with and without diabetes and evaluated using various performance metrics.

## Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes,
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries and packages:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook



## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `Diabetes detection project/diabetes.csv`: This directory contains the dataset files used for training and testing.
- `Diabetes detection project/diabetes detection model.ipynb`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook files with the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files in the `Diabetes detection project/diabetes detection model.ipynb` directory to explore the code and run the project.

## Usage

Follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook files to execute the code and perform the following tasks:

- Data preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, normalize or scale the features.
- Model training: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset.
- Model evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy.

## Result

 - The accuracy score for the training data is 78%.
 - The accuracy score for the testing data is 79%.
